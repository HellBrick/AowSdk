## Intro

This is a public snapshot of the AoW 2 SDK created as a part of MP Evolution project to analyze and manipulate the game files.
Originally there were no plans to release it, because it could easily be used for subtle and untraceable cheating, which would ruin the competitive gaming.
But now that the online community has been dead for quite a while, the reason not to release it is gone.
And as I recently learned that there's still a few people who are interested in modifying the game,
I've decided to finally open source this SDK to facilitate the work of these dedicated people.

Please keep in mind that this is a very old codebase, and some parts of it are not for the faint of heart ;)
But it does contain some very valuable knowledge about the game resources, so I hope you'll find it useful.
